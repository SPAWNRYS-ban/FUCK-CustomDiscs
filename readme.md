# FUCK Custom Discs | v5.1.1 for Paper and forks 1.21.7 / 1.21.8
### Custom Discs with removed version and core checking

- Play custom music discs, goat horns and player heads using the Simple Voice Chat API. (The voice chat mod is required on the client and server.)
- Use ```/customdisc``` or ```/cd``` to view available commands.
- Music files should go into ```plugins/CustomDiscs/musicdata/```
- Music files must be in the ```.wav```, ```.flac```, or ```.mp3``` format.

Downloading Files:
- To download a file use the command ```/cd download <url> <filename.extension>```.
  - The link used to download a file must be a direct link (meaning the file must automatically begin downloading when accessing the link).
  - Files must have the correct extension specified.
  - An UnsupportedAudioFileException will be thrown in the server's console if the file extension is not correct (for example when giving a wav file the mp3 extension).
  - Below is an example of how to use the command and a link to get direct downloads from Google Drive.
    - Example: ```/cd download "https://example.com/mysong" mysong.mp3```
    - **To note** : Do not forget to use quotes (") for the URL. Without this, you'll get a command error.
- Direct Google Drive links: https://lonedev6.github.io/gddl/

Set the range of a disc:
- To set the active range of a playable disc, just use the command ```/cd range <range>```.
  - The range can be between 1 and the max value set in the config file (default : 256)
- Example: ```/cd range 100```

Permission Nodes (Required to run the commands. Playing discs does not require a permission.):
- ```customdiscs.create``` to create a disc
- ```customdiscs.download``` to download a file
- ```customdiscs.range``` to set the range of the disc
- ```customdiscs.horncooldown``` to set the cooldown (in ticks) for custom goat horns

Dependencies:
- This plugin depends on the latest version of ProtocolLib available for your Paper version and SimpleVoiceChatBukkit (latest is recommended - at least version 2.5.31 required).
